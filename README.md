# Rare: The Publishing Platform for the Discerning Writer

## Project Overview:
Rare Publishing is a Full-Stack group project with collaboration from students in Cohort 60 of Nashville Software School.
This app was initially supported by a server built with [Python](https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-python-server-tyrannical-tators). The backend was then re-built using Django REST framework.


## Primary Features:
The Goal of this web app is to allow authors to create blogposts.
Authors can also view other's blogposts and their own in list form as well as in detail.
They can edit and delete if they no longer like their blogposts.
They can also create and delete categories that they can then assign to a blogpost.


## Target Audience:
People who want to share ideas, opinions, topics, thoughts, and current events.


## Purpose and problems it solves:
It's a mutual space for anyone that wants to share and read other's ideas.
Instead of searching Google you can now go to this site to read opinions(totally not like Twitter or Facebook).


## Getting Started:
1. In the terminal, create a directory
```bash
cd <new directory name>
```

2. Run 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nss-day-cohort-60/rare-client-tenacious-tators.git
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the code
```bash
npm start
```
5. This will initialize the React app in your browser, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the server side of this project. To download and start the server, go [HERE](https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/django-taters-api) and follow the README there.

6. Once you are running the server, create a new user, log in to view the site, and test out the features!
